# whopaysfordinner

A little toy/tutorial app in JS and React to randomlize a list of peoples names and pick a loser who pays for dinner :-p. Just playing around with react-bootstrap and react.

The app works like this: 
1.) Enter the folks who might pay for dinner one at a time
2.) Hit "Pick a loser"
